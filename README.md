# Event-Management-Backend-Application
Event Management Backend app using Spring Boot and Hibernate for handling event scheduling, registration, and data management.
### Development of Event Management Backend Application

We developed the Event Management Backend application using REST APIs with Spring Boot and Hibernate. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **REST APIs**: We designed and implemented RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations for events and registrations. These APIs facilitate communication between the client and server, ensuring efficient data exchange.

2. **Spring Boot**: Using Spring Boot, we created a robust and scalable backend. Spring Boot's annotations like `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, and `@Autowired` simplified the development process by reducing boilerplate code and enabling dependency injection.

3. **Hibernate**: Hibernate ORM was used for database interactions. We mapped Java classes to database tables using annotations like `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, and `@GeneratedValue`. This allowed us to perform CRUD operations seamlessly.

4. **Entity Relationships**: We established connections between entities using annotations. For example, a one-to-many relationship between `Event` and `Registration` entities was created using `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToOne` annotations. This ensured referential integrity and enabled efficient data retrieval.

5. **Database Configuration**: We configured the database connection in the `application.properties` file, specifying details like the database URL, username, and password. Hibernate automatically created the necessary tables based on the entity mappings.

Overall, the combination of Spring Boot, REST APIs, and Hibernate allowed us to develop a clean, maintainable, and efficient backend for the Event Management application.
